      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the 
      road today:
      <p>
      <blockquote>Passing cars,<br>
         When you cant't see, <br>
         May getyou,<br>
         A glimpse,<br>
         Of eternity.<br>
        </blockquote>
      </p>
       I definitely won't be Passing any cars
    </p>

      My first day of the trip! I can't beliece I finally got
      everthing packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to vring a whole lot with meï¼š cell phone, iPod,
      digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As 
      Lao Tzu would have said. <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
      with one Segway</q>
